			<h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our class blog. We are class 1C and our teacher is Miss Alexandra. Together we all make up an amazing team!
           In colaboration we are creating this brand new blog so that we can invite you to share and experience our learning journey with us.<br>
        <br>
           In 1C we love to explore and enjoy a creative, child led, fun curriculum. We also have our very own class guest, Noah, our class teddy! Each week, one lucky 'rising star' and hardworking child will have the opportunity to take Noah home for the weekend and return with a diary and pictures to show the rest of the class during the week.                <br>
        <br>
           There are so many exciting things to head your way so be sure to check our blog regularly as we will be updating you often regarding everything that we have been exploring across the curriculum. Thank you for reading!</p>
        <br>

			<h2>English</h2>
        <p>Each week the children will be set 3 books to read online. These books can be found on the <a href="https://www.activelearnprimary.co.uk/" target="blank">ActiveLearn</a> website, using the username and password that you were given at the beginning of the school year. When these books are read, website rewards will be given for completing these activities. There will also be a list of 10 spellings to learn each week at home, with a spelling review each Friday. Please take the time to help your child with this.</p>
			<h2>Math</h2>
			  <p>Math homework will usually relate to the learning that has taken place in class and will help them to practice and improve these skills further. This will usually be online, again using the ActiveLearn platform, and will come in the form of a game or fun activity. I would also recommend practicing multiplications at home to help support the understanding of the number system. For this I recommend reviewing the 10, 5, 2 and 3 times tables. </p>

    <div class="content-3">
	    <h2>Weekly Sport Lessons</h2>
        <p>Each week the children will take part in a sports lesson with Mr Chris and Miss Ellie. The children will have sport each Monday, Wednesday and Friday. In order to get the best and full experience out of their sports lessons it is vital that you ensure your child has their FULL sports kit in school with them every Monday. This will then be taken home each Friday. Alongside of this, please could I ask that all items of clothing should be clearly marked with you child's full name and class details. This will help to keep all items of sportwear safe. Due to the heat, the children should also have access to water from home as the children can get quite warm in the lessons.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your support with this matter!</p>

      <h2> Daily Snack Routines</h2>
        <p>Snack time is a part of our morning routine but also each afternoon from October to May. Our aim is to maintain the childrenâ€™s energy levels and maximise learning potential by providing a nutritious food break. This time of the day is also a lovely time to reflect and discuss our acheivements and/or anything else the children would like to discuss. As we are a healthy school that promotes healthy eating, we ask that students have a healthy snack of a yoghurt drink/milk for the morning and then, when afternoon snacks are applicable, fruit or vegetables supplied daily in manageable quantities. These should be brought into school in a clear ziplock bag or a container, both of which should be clearly marked with a name and class details. Furthermore, as the weather is often very hot, students will be encouraged to drink water throughout the day. We also ask that your child bring a labelled water bottle to school on a daily basis.
      </p>

    <div class="content-5">
			<h2>Bring Your Own Device</h2>
        <p>Bring your own device (BYOD) involves allowing students to bring their own devices, such as iPads or other tablet devices into classrooms to support improving student learning outcomes. As a school, we believe that in pupils bringing their own devices it encourages a student-centered, active learning approach, with students taking more responsibility for their own learning. For this reason the children are encouraged to bring a device of their own from home. Before this can happen, the children and parent(s)/gurdian(s) must accept a BYOD policy agreement so that we can create a safe and secure learning environment through promoting the safe use of internet and apps. From time to time your child may be asked to download an app so that this can be used within school and we ask that this can be done to ensure the children can access the learning points.
        <br>
      <br>
      Should you need any more information on the BYOD policy, please do not hesisitate to contact the school.</p>
