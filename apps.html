        <h1>Recommended App List</h1>
        <p>Dear Parent(s) and Guardian(s),
          <br>
          <br>
          Below I have created a list of any useful apps that I feel could help your childâ€™s progression in school. These, by no means, are a necessity and are simply there as a guidance for you.
          <br>
          <br>
          Where possible I have tried only to include free apps, however if you find any payed for apps these have all been tried and tested firstly and therefore are only recommended because I feel they are of a very high quality.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is not an exhaustive list and I am aware that these are not the only apps that will be useful for children. Please feel free to inform me if you feel that I have missed out any apps that you think ought to be in this list.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, any apps that I feel are invaluable to have in class I have included double asterisk, as followed (**).
          <br>
          <br>
          Kind regards,
          <br>
          <br>
          Miss Alexandra.
